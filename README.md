####Some tests with D3

A little bit about this visualization: Hovering over a circle will give you the date and mean degrees for that date. Hotter days are red and cooler days are blue. I wanted to show the extremes so there is a threshold set for temps under 60 or over 85 degrees which increases the radius of the circle. These tempuratures would be considered quite extreme here.
